# Smart Parking System

## Overview

The Smart Parking System is an IoT-based project aimed at improving parking management in urban areas. The system uses computer vision and sensors to monitor parking spaces in real time, allowing users to find available spots quickly and efficiently. The system is designed to help both users and parking lot managers by reducing the time spent searching for parking and optimizing the overall parking process.

## Features

- **Real-time Parking Space Availability:** Detects and displays available parking spots in real time using IoT sensors and computer vision.
- **Smart Reservation System:** Allows users to reserve a parking spot in advance through a user-friendly web interface.
- **User Notifications:** Sends notifications to users about available parking spaces and reservation status.
- **Admin Dashboard:** A dashboard for parking lot administrators to monitor parking spot usage, occupancy rates, and manage reservations.
- **Cloud Storage Integration:** Stores parking data (reservations, available spots, etc.) using Firebase for scalability and real-time synchronization.
- **Mobile-Friendly Interface:** The web interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring ease of use across different devices.

## Technologies Used

- **IoT Devices:** Sensors to detect the occupancy of parking spaces.
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV for image processing and detecting available parking spaces.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express for server-side logic and Firebase for cloud storage.
- **Frontend:** React.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Database:** Firebase for real-time data syncing and storage.

## Installation

To set up the Smart Parking System locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) should be installed on your system.
- A Firebase account and project setup to handle cloud storage.
